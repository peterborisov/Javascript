## `What are Semantic Elements?`
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.<br/>
Non-semantic elements: **<div>** and **<span>** - Tells nothing about its content.<br/>
Semantic elements: **<form>, <table>, and <article>** - Clearly defines its content.<br/>
Semantically correct HTML helps search engines, screen readers, and other user devices determine the significance and context of web content.<br/>
Since October 2014, HTML4 got upgraded to HTML5, along with some new “semantic” elements.
